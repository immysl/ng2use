        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>We are the team known as Exilee Coders. We love and code Angular 2. 
          We watch Star Wars movies. And laugh at Shai Reznik&rsquo;s hilarious videos. So for this hackathon, we
          thought of building a mini app that might be useful to the wider community. The app shows the current status
          of Angular 2 related libraries/modules and a bit of Star Wars menace.</p>
