# ng2use

A mini app for Angular savvy users to check the latest status of the main modules/libraries of Angular 2. The app pulls in data from the GitHub API to display module specific code. However, there are some data that we maintain in a JSON file to show the current status of these modules. This is similar to how Caniuse.com uses but sans a real DB (uses JSON on the frontend for this).

A user can click on a module and it expands to show the module specific data (pulled in from GitHub). Also the modules can be searched by their module name and filtered by their status.
